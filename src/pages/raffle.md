## Raffle Conditions

[conditions](/conditions/)

Neither NFT represents a purchase, but a chance to win.

only NFT tokens bought **before** April 4th 2020, 23:00 can participate.
tokens bought as a later day are donations without expectation of any return.

We are very sorry for the possibly misleading wording in the mintbase nft token description,
unfortunately, human error is an unintended sideeffect of too many things to do and not enought time.
3 of our team sat together, and all of us were part of the communication finalizing creation of the nfts.
None of us thought about immutability.

electricity and other amenities in our hq.
