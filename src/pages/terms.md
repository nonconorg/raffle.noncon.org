## Raffle Conditions

Neither NFT represents a purchase, but a chance to win.

All times in the Timezone of Vienna, Europe, GMT+1,
depending on daylight savings time differences and stuff.

just look up "what time is it in vienna" in your favorite search engine.

only NFT tokens bought **before** April 4th 2020, 23:00, Vienna Time, can participate.
tokens bought as a later date are considered donations without expectation of any return,
but we will return them if sent by accident, just contact us.

We are very sorry for the possibly misleading wording in the mintbase nft token description,
unfortunately, human error is an unintended sideeffect of too many things to do and not enought time.

3 of our team sat together, and all of us were part of the communication finalizing creation of the nfts.
None of us thought about immutability.

That's pretty much it, apply common sense and all will be fine.
