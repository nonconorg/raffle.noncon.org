## Raffle ToS

This document is a draft and an rfc.

### Jurisidiction

NONCON ORG understands that most jurisdictions will not accept the legal authority of this document.

NONCON ORG is a virtual organization, composed of voluntarily participating individuals,
we do not accept the legal authority of those jurisdictions,
brought onto us by coercion, not choice.

NONCON 2020 is a virtual event and association of vountarily participating individuals.
It does not exist as a physical representation,
and we consider it outside of any jurisdictions,
which means that we, NONCON ORG, exist in our own virtual jurisdiction we just made up.

In jurisdictions where any kind of purchase comes with consumer rights,
the PARTICIPANTS forfeit their right to a trial period,
their right to return, their right to any kind of refund,
unless those rights are granted by the cryptographically signed contract
both NONCON and the PARTICIPANTS signed cryptographically
when they engaged in any kind of transaction with each other.

If this forfeit of rights is legally impossible,
both NONCON and the PARTICIPANTS agree
that before any judgements regarding the specific clauses of this cryptographic contract are made,
the general extend and applicability of coverage by the law of that jurisdiction has to be defined.

This terms and condition are incomplete,
any amendments will be in the spirit of the existing terms and conditions.

### Tokens

Bought NFT Tokens represent a chance to win, not a purchase.

### Refundability

Tokens bought **AFTER** May 1st 2020, 00:00, Vienna Time
are considered donations without expectation of any return,
but we will return them if the token gets bought after that date and/or by accident,
just contact us through any of our published [communication channels](https://noncon.org/#connect).

Both the raffle provider "NOCNON ORG" and the raffle PARTICIPANTS agree,
that this the tokens bought for this raffle are a cryptographically binding,
immutable and permanent commitment to follow the terms
defined in this document, available on
[https://raffle.noncon.org/terms/](https://raffle.noncon.org/terms/).

All times listed are in the timezone of Vienna, Europe, GMT+1 or GMT+2,
depending on daylight savings time differences. Dates are hard.

This is called "Vienna Time" in the rest of the document.

### Time restrictions

##### shame.

We are very sorry for the possibly misleading wording in the mintbase nft token description,
unfortunately, human error is an unintended sideeffect of too many things to do and not enought time.

3 of our team sat together, and all of us were part of the communication finalizing creation of the nfts.

None of us thought about immutability.
