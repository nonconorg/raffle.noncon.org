Welcome to the [noncon 2020](https://noncon.org/) raffle page.

The whole noncon raffle, as well as this homepage, are very much a work in progress.

Things to do:

Watch the [raffle](/raffle/),
read about the technical details on the [docs](/docs/) page,
send us a [donation](/donation/), and, of course, [buy a nft token](/nft/).

The Raffle page shows a simulation at the moment, it will get closer and closer to the real deal,
at one point we will connect to blockchains and automate the processes.
