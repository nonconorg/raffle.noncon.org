# raffle docs

Documentation will be gathered here.

This is a very young project.

The raffle will use seeded, reproducible random.

The seed will be gathered from multiple blockchains.

All blocks in those chains that are generated between april 30th, 23:00 and may 1st, 0:00
will contribute random noise to the seed.

there will be a smart contract in the future, and custom, expiring tokens.
