# raffle docs

Documentation will be gathered here.

This is a very young project.

The raffle will use seeded, reproducible random.

The seed will be gathered from multiple blockchains.

All blocks in those chains that are generated between April 30th 2020, 23:00 and May 1st, 00:00
will contribute random noise to the seed.

there will be a smart contract in the future, and custom, expiring tokens.
